            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello there! I'm Justin, a web development enthusiast based in Cabuyao, Laguna, Philippines. My path to the digital world wasn't exactly a straight line – my high school journey took me through the culinary arts and even beauty care! While I found a connection in the creativity of cooking, it was my introduction to ICT in senior high and later, web development in college, that truly sparked my interest.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                That initial experience with basic HTML in notepad, creating those classic marquee effects and playing with colors, was surprisingly captivating. Although life took a detour with part-time work and other commitments (including a brief stint as a barista!), the idea of building something tangible and visually engaging online – a modern-day resume, if you will – stuck with me. The ability to showcase skills and creations for others to see is a significant motivator. While I'll admit debugging can test my patience, the sheer satisfaction of seeing a project finally come to life is incredibly rewarding.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                My college journey has further fueled this exploration. Beyond the basics, I've dabbled in more complex projects like a heart disease risk assessment system using Python and Streamlit, a secure login system with PHP and SQL, and even a fun animal guessing game in Unity. These experiences, while diverse, have solidified my interest in the practical application of technology. Interestingly, my recent On-the-Job Training at Concentrix in Nuvali also ignited a fascination for the hardware side of tech, adding another layer to my learning goals.

            <p>
                When it comes to web development, I'm particularly drawn to the visual design and interactive elements – the "eye-candy" that captures people's attention. Outside the digital realm, I'm a big fan of good food (living in the Philippines, how could I not be?), enjoy strategizing in Mobile Legends, and cherish spending quality time with my girlfriend. I believe that even these seemingly unrelated interests can find their expression in the creative possibilities of web development.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                While I might sometimes feel like I lean on AI as a learning tool (and who doesn't in this age?), I'm driven by a desire to be more than just "normal." I'm eager to solidify my skills, explore the hardware world, and ultimately contribute meaningfully to the tech landscape. This e-portfolio is a step in that journey, a place where I can showcase what I've built and who I am.
